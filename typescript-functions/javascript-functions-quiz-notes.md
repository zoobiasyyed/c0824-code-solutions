## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?

They are reusable blocks of code that either return a value or perform an operation

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.

It includes the name of the function and the parameters, a code block, and sometimes a return statement

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.

the name of the function with parenthese placed next to it

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?

The function call will just print the result to the console however many times you run it, The function is actually being executed. The deinition includes all the parameters and a whole block of code

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?

A parameter is a like a placeholder variable, and the argument is what replaces the parameter when running the function.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?

They are useful because u can then pass any argument in the function based off the parameters, and it is helpful especially if you dont know the value of the argument yet.

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?

It allows the function to produce a value, and it prevents more code from being run once returned.

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?

There is a const variable equal to a set of parameters within parentheses, which is followed by an equal sign and the greater than sign, and then curly brackets

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?

It becomes an implicit return, meaning it will return the value without using the return keyword.
