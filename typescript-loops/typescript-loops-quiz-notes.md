## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of a loop?

A loop allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. Loops are useful for tasks that require repetitive actions, such as iterating over items in a list or performing calculations multiple times.

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?

determines whether the loop should continue to execute or terminate.

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?

the process of executing the loop's body once.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?

gets evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop's body executes; if the condition is false, the loop terminates.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

gets evaluated once, at the beginning of the loop, before the first iteration.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

If the condition is true, the loop's body executes; if the condition is false, the loop terminates.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?

gets evaluated after each iteration of the loop's body, before the condition is checked for the next iteration

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?

The break keyword exits a loop immediately

- What does the `++` increment operator do?

increases the value of a variable by 1

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?

using a for in loop
